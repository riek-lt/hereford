# svelte app

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run serve
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies`.
